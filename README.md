# Some of my solutions to various programming challanges
The filenames should roughly match the challange names.

Most of the code is not elegant, but always meets the required space and time
complexity.

# Contributing
Improvements and suggestions are welcome! Although I will probably not go back
and improve my solutions to old problems, as solving new ones is just more fun :D
