# Some of my solutions to various programming challanges
The filenames should roughly match the challange names.

Most of the code is not elegant, but always meets the required space and time
complexity.

# Contributing
This is purely an archive of my code. There's nothing to contribute.
I will not be answering questions/providing explainations of any code.
If it works, great. If not, tough luck. (This sounds a bit harsh, sorry.)
